# Few-Shot NLG
Code and data for paper Few-Shot NLG with Pre-Trained Language Model
https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09521


## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Instructions
Data and pre-trained GPT-2 can be downloaded via dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u3t8yhcctqczpo0/AAAZV7S-qoIyaQW99r_88nUra?dl=0
```
-- sample_data: a sample train and test data for humans domain
-- data: full datasets for songs and books domain
-- models: pre-trained GPT-2 
```
To run our code, go to the code folder and run with: 

python ./Main.py --root_path ~/Data/NLP/few_shot_nlg/ --domain humans --gpt_model_name ../models/117M/ --output_path ~/Output/

Where the root path is the data folder. Specify an output path to store the results. The data preprocessing code can be found in preprocess.py.
